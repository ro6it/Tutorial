# Automated AMI Backups
# This code refered with slight changes: https://gist.github.com/bkozora/724e01903a9ad481d21e
#
# This script will search for all instances having a tag with "Backup" 
# on it and are in 'running' state. As soon as it has the instances list, it loop through each instance
# and create an AMI of it. Also, it will look for a "Retention" tag key which
# will be used as a retention policy number in days. If there is no tag with
# that name, it will use a 4 days default value for each AMI.If there is no tag with that name, it will use a 7 days default value for each AMI.
#
# After creating the AMI it creates a "DeleteOn" tag on the AMI indicating when
# it will be deleted using the Retention value and another Lambda function
