Step 1: Install Java OpenJDK
#sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel

Step 2: Create a User
Running WildFly as the root user is a security risk and not considered best practice.
To create a new system user and group named wildfly with home directory /opt/wildfly run:
#sudo groupadd -r wildfly
#sudo useradd -r -g wildfly -d /opt/wildfly -s /sbin/nologin wildfly

Step 3: Install WildFly
Download link- http://wildfly.org/downloads/
#wget packagelink
When the download is completed, unpack the tar.gz file and move it to the /opt directory:
#sudo tar xf /tmp/wildfly-$WILDFLY_VERSION.tar.gz -C /opt/

Next, create a symbolic link wildfly that will point to the WildFly installation directory:
sudo ln -s /opt/wildfly-$WILDFLY_VERSION /opt/wildfly

WildFly will run under the wildfly user which needs to have access to the WildFly installation directory.
#sudo chown -RH wildfly: /opt/wildfly

Step 4: Configure Systemd
The WildFly package includes files necessary to run WildFly as a service.

Start by creating a directory which will hold the WildFly configuration file:
sudo mkdir -p /etc/wildfly
Copy the configuration file to the /etc/wildfly directory:
#sudo cp /opt/wildfly/docs/contrib/scripts/systemd/wildfly.conf /etc/wildfly/
By default, WildFly will run in a standalone mode and will listen on all interfaces. You can edit the file according to your needs.
# The configuration you want to run
WILDFLY_CONFIG=standalone.xml

# The mode you want to run
WILDFLY_MODE=standalone

# The address to bind to
WILDFLY_BIND=0.0.0.0

Next copy the WildFly launch.sh script to the /opt/wildfly/bin/ directory:
sudo cp /opt/wildfly/docs/contrib/scripts/systemd/launch.sh /opt/wildfly/bin/
The scripts inside bin directory must have executable flag:
sudo sh -c 'chmod +x /opt/wildfly/bin/*.sh'
Copy the systemd unit file named to the /etc/systemd/system/ directory:
sudo cp /opt/wildfly/docs/contrib/scripts/systemd/wildfly.service /etc/systemd/system/
Notify systemd that we created a new unit file:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

Start the WildFly service an enable it to be automatically started at boot time by running:
sudo systemctl start wildfly
sudo systemctl enable wildfly
sudo systemctl status wildfly

Step 5: Firewall If needed,
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=8080/tcpsudo 
firewall-cmd --reload

Step 6: Configure WildFly Authentication

To add a new user use the add-user.sh script that is located the WildFly’s bin directory:
sudo /opt/wildfly/bin/add-user.sh

What type of user do you wish to add? 
 a) Management User (mgmt-users.properties) 
 b) Application User (application-users.properties)
(a):

Enter the details of the new user to add.
Using realm 'ManagementRealm' as discovered from the existing property files.
Username : linuxize
Password recommendations are listed below. To modify these restrictions edit the add-user.properties configuration file.
 - The password should be different from the username
 - The password should not be one of the following restricted values {root, admin, administrator}
 - The password should contain at least 8 characters, 1 alphabetic character(s), 1 digit(s), 1 non-alphanumeric symbol(s)
Password : 
Re-enter Password : 
What groups do you want this user to belong to? (Please enter a comma separated list, or leave blank for none)[  ]: 
About to add user 'linuxize' for realm 'ManagementRealm'
Is this correct yes/no? yes
Added user 'linuxize' to file '/opt/wildfly-16.0.0.Final/standalone/configuration/mgmt-users.properties'
Added user 'linuxize' to file '/opt/wildfly-16.0.0.Final/domain/configuration/mgmt-users.properties'
Added user 'linuxize' with groups  to file '/opt/wildfly-16.0.0.Final/standalone/configuration/mgmt-groups.properties'
Added user 'linuxize' with groups  to file '/opt/wildfly-16.0.0.Final/domain/configuration/mgmt-groups.properties'
Is this new user going to be used for one AS process to connect to another AS process? 
e.g. for a slave host controller connecting to the master or for a Remoting connection for server to server EJB calls.
yes/no? yes
To represent the user add the following to the server-identities definition <secret value="UGFuMjNkZWo3NyNA" />

Step 6: Test the WildFly Installation
http://<your_domain_or_IP_address>:8080

Step 7: Access WildFly Administration Console

Command-Line Interface
To access the WildFly Administration Console from the command line you can use the jboss-cli.sh script.
Navigate to the WildFly’s bin directory and run the script with the --connect option:
cd /opt/wildfly/bin/
./jboss-cli.sh --connect
You will be asked to enter your administrative username and password (created in step 6):
Authenticating against security realm: ManagementRealm
Username: linuxize
Password:

Once you login the console prompt will change to [standalone@localhost:9990 /]. Type help to get a list of commands and command syntax.
From here you can deploy and undeploy your applications, manage users and groups and configure and monitor WildFly server.

Web Interface
If you prefer to manage your server from the GUI, WildFly also provides a web-based console.
By default, the WildFly administration console is available only from localhost at http://localhost:9990/console. Sign in using the user you have created in step 6.


If you want to access the console from remote locations you’ll need to make small modifications to the wildfly.service, wildfly.conf and launch.sh files.

Open the wildfly.conf and append WILDFLY_CONSOLE_BIND=0.0.0.0 at the end of the file.

/etc/wildfly/wildfly.conf
# The configuration you want to run
WILDFLY_CONFIG=standalone.xml

# The mode you want to run
WILDFLY_MODE=standalone

# The address to bind to
WILDFLY_BIND=0.0.0.0

# The address console to bind to
WILDFLY_CONSOLE_BIND=0.0.0.0

Open the launch.sh and edit the highlighted lines: /opt/wildfly/bin/launch.sh
#!/bin/bash

if [ "x$WILDFLY_HOME" = "x" ]; then
    WILDFLY_HOME="/opt/wildfly"
fi

if [[ "$1" == "domain" ]]; then
    $WILDFLY_HOME/bin/domain.sh -c $2 -b $3 -bmanagement $4
else
    $WILDFLY_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -c $2 -b $3 -bmanagement $4
fi

Restart the service for changes to take effect:
Open the wildfly.service and edit the highlighted lines:
[Unit]
Description=The WildFly Application Server
After=syslog.target network.target
Before=httpd.service

[Service]
Environment=LAUNCH_JBOSS_IN_BACKGROUND=1
EnvironmentFile=-/etc/wildfly/wildfly.conf
User=wildfly
LimitNOFILE=102642
PIDFile=/var/run/wildfly/wildfly.pid
ExecStart=/opt/wildfly/bin/launch.sh $WILDFLY_MODE $WILDFLY_CONFIG $WILDFLY_BIND $WILDFLY_CONSOLE_BIND
StandardOutput=null

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Create the /var/run/wildfly directory and set correct permissions:

sudo mkdir /var/run/wildfly/
sudo chown wildfly: /var/run/wildfly/

Notify systemd that the unit file was changed:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart wildfly

Assuming that port 9990 is not blocked in your firewall, you should be able to access the WildFly administration console at http://<your_domain_or_IP_address>:9990/console.
